- Historical lendingclub data and analysis

These may be completely obvious, but I've made the following observations from retrospective analysis of the lendingclub data:
* Borrowers with certain loan purposes default more than others.
* Borrowers from certain states default more than others.

The purpose of these utilities are for historical analysis only.  The standard disclaimers apply:
* Use at your own risk.
* Past performance is not indicative of future performance.
